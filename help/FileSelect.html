<html>File with Variables (xls): here you can select the sheet including subject IDs and their<br> demographic/genetic/etc. data that you wish to be analyzed with e.g. correlations, group<br> comparisons etc. (a selection prompt will appear to select the variable that you wish being<br> included from the variables sheet). When planning to do group comparisons it is also<br> possible to enter strings to define the groups (e.g. male vs. female instead of 0 vs. 1).<br> Subsequently, a variable containing strings must be selected by hand in the selection<br> prompt. When starting a new workspace the variables list refers to the “Variables” file.</html>
