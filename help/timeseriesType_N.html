<html>Number of random series: allows setting the number of random time series to be<br> created for each “original” nodal time course. This number equals the amount of<br> iterations for generating the pairwise null-model distributions against which<br> the original r value is tested. A high number of iterations is advisable to obtain valid<br> and reliable non-parametric p-values.</html>
