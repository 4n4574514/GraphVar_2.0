<html>Random_shuffle: by using this option the values comprising the subject’s<br> association matrix are randomly shuffeled using the “random_shuffle” function<br> implemented in GraphVar (src/calc/helper folder) keeping the degree of positive<br> and negative weights for the random networks the same as in the original network.<br> Compared to the “null_model_und_signed” function this option is less<br> conservative but very fast. Random_shuffle does not need an input for number of iterations.<br><br><br>Null_model_und_sign: uses the “null_model_und_sign” function of the BCT.</html>
