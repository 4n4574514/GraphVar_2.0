<html>Calculate graph metrics: when selecting this option GraphVar will compute the brain graph<br> metrics that you have chosen in the selection field below (multiple selection is possible; mouse + ctrl).<br> Most of the network topological features are available in their binary or<br> weighted form and the type of the network (binary/weighted) is accordingly generated<br> based on this selection, while you are free to choose both types at the same time <br>(please refer to “Appendix 1” for the default output of the graph metrics and to<br> “Appendix 2:” for how to include your own functions into GraphVar).</html>
