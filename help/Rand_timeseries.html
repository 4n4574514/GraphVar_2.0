<html>Create random time series: (only works in combination with the “Generate Correlation<br> Matrix” option) by non-parametric testing of the correlation strenght (r) of any two nodes in<br> the n x n matrix against a multiple iteration derived distribution of correlation strengths<br> between random time series (pairwise null-model-distribution), this option allows to derive<br> p-values (retrieved by placing the “original” correlation value in the corresponding null-model<br> distribution and determining its percentile position) for each connection in<br> the correlation matrix that can be used for thresholding of the network (i.e. to create the<br> adjacency matrix) or/and for determining a threshold for subsequent association-matrix<br> based statistics (please refer to the “The Raw Matrix (link wise) panel”). The creation of<br> random time series can also be used in combination with the “Partial correlation” option<br> (in this case - per iteration - a “random” correlation value entering the respective pairwise <br>null-model distribution is controlled for the random time series of the selected nodes<br> in the network). Thresholding based on the non-parametric p-values is performed in the “Network Construction”<br> panel under “Significant/Significance level”.</html>
