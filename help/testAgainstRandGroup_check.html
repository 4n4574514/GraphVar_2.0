<html>Test against random groups: when selecting this option GraphVar performs a non-parametric<br> permutation test with a user defined amount of repetitions. For permutation <br>testing, in each repetition, the network measures (or connectivity values in case of “The Raw Matrix (link wise) panel”<br> calculations) of each subject are randomly reassigned to one of the<br> groups so that each randomized group obtains the same number of subjects as the original groups.<br> Then, the differences in network measures between randomized groups are calculated<br> resulting in a permutation distribution of difference under the null hypothesis<br> (for ANOVA also the F value deriving from each repetition is computed). The actual<br> between-group difference in network measures (and for ANOVA also the F value) is then<br> placed in the corresponding permutation distribution and a p-value is calculated based on <br>its percentile position. For how to correct the result by applying the non-parametric p-values <br>please refer to the “Results” section under “Correction”.<br><br><br>It is also possible to perform group comparison analyses on the “raw” correlation/association<br> matrices (i.e., association-matrix based statistics, where no graph topological measures<br> are involved). For this feature you have to check this box and also check the “Raw Matrix (link wise)” option.<br><br><br>As described in the “The Raw Matrix (link wise) panel” introduction, it is necessary to<br> determine whether a Graph-Component with a certain size as a result of the<br> correlational analysis is non-random. Thus, amount and size of Graph-Components<br> resulting from “random data” are needed to be compared against the true Graph-Components. <br>For group comparisons on the raw matrix GraphVar produces these<br> “random data” by performing non-parametric permutation tests with the subjects<br> underlying connectivity values for the respective groups. Thus, to produce this random data you need to select the “Test against random groups”<br> option in the group comparison panel and enter the amount of repetitions. When selecting<br> this option GraphVar simultaneously performs parametric testing of the group<br> difference on each link, which gives you the option to choose between parametric<br> and non-parametric p-values for determining for inspection of single links. However,<br> significant links in the Graph-Components are determined by the parametric p-values <br>as it would be circular to create p-values from random data and then use the same<br> random data again for Graph-Components (please refer to the “Network Inspector”<br> section for determining the significance value of links considered for Graph-Components<br> and for more info about p-values for true Graph-Components).</html>
