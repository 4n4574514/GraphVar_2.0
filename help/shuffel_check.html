<html>Generate random networks: as described in the “The Raw Matrix (link wise)”<br> introduction, it is necessary to determine whether a Graph-Component with a certain<br> size as a result of the correlational analysis is non-random. Thus, amount and size of<br> Graph-Components of random networks (random association-matrices) need to be<br> compared against the true Graph-Components. GraphVar offers two options to create<br> subject specific random networks (see below). Subsequently, the subject specific<br> variable selected for correlation (e.g. age) undergoes link wise correlational analyses on <br>the original and the random networks. Only significant correlations of the user defined<br> variable (e.g. age) with a network link are considered for Graph-Components <br>(please refer to the “Network Inspector” section for determining the significance value of links<br> considered for Graph-Components<br> and for more info about p-values for true Graph-Components). To actually test against the random networks you have to select the<br> “Test against random networks (correlation)” checkbox. When selecting this option <br>GraphVar simultaneously performs non-parametric testing of the correlation strenght,<br> which gives you the option to choose between parametric and non-parametric p-values<br> for inspection of single links. However, significant links in the Graph-Components are <br>determined by the parametric p-values as it would be circular to create p-values from <br>random data and then use the same random data again for Graph-Components <br>(for more info refer to the “Test against random networks (Correlation)” option.</html>
