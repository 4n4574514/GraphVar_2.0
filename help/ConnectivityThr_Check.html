<html>Connectivity Thr.: this option allows to restrict analyses on links that are significant in the<br> first place. Significance values for each link have to be computed beforehand using the<br> “Create random time series” option. When selecting this checkbox, a selection window<br> appears which demands you to select the array in which the p-values are stored <br>(GraphVar will create this array and save it in the subjects .mat file when generating<br> correlation matrices out of time series signals).<br><br><br>There are three options (accessible via script “src/calc/CalcCorMatrix.m”, line:<br> “nan_method”) how GraphVar handles the connectivities between nodes that do not<br> reach significance: “mean” (default: for every connection that is not significant <br>the mean connectivity value of the entire sample is used for replacement);”nan” (missing <br>connectivities are treated as Nan); “zero” (missing connectivities are treated as zero).<br><br> Keep this in mind when interpreting results derived by applying thresholds</html>
