<html>The “BrainRegions” file contains the regions of the AAL atlas, which are commonly<br> used for node definition in graph analyses. However, you can substitute these regions<br> with the nodes you need for you analysis (e.g. task-fMRI derived regions of interest or<br> any other brain atlas). As GraphVar is not limited to a specific number of nodes you can<br> define your own brain parcellation scheme. When doing so by creating your own<br> BrainRegions file, it is important to keep in line with the structure of the original sheets <br>as GraphVar will refer to it (also refer to the “ROI_template” folder).</html>
