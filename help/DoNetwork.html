<html>The “Raw Matrix (link wise)” panel offers to perform network based statistics<br> (association matrix based statistics) by applying either correlational and/or group <br>comparison analyses (please refer to the “Raw Matrix –Correlation” <br>and “Raw Matrix – Group” section below). The addition “link wise” means that the respective analysis is<br> performed on each link between any two nodes in the n x n matrix. Thus, this feature is<br> inherently a mass-univariate approach that examines the significance of each link with<br> respect to the applied analysis. However, to deal with the problem of alpha inflation <br>(i.e., multiple comparison problem), GraphVar makes use of so called Graph-Components <br>(i.e., subnetworks in which all pairs of nodes are connected by significant links) that are identified<br> by the BCT “get_components” function. The measure of interest with regard to Graph-Components<br> is their size (this is similar to a contiguous cluster of voxels in fMRI). <br>To evaluate, whether a Graph-Component with a certain size as a result of the respective<br> analysis is non-random, it is compared against the amount and size of Graph-Components in <br>“random” data (please refer to the respective analysis type described below). Based on this,<br> a p-value for each non-random Graph-Component is computed similar as in AFNIs AlphaSim <br>(for how to view the resulting Graph-Components and a more detailed description of the p-value <br>computation for Graph-Components please refer to the “Network Inspector” section).<br><br><br>TIP: with the raw matrix function, it is also possible to examine correlations/group<br> differences between a set of a-priori specified structures (e.g. correlation of age on<br> insula-amygdala connectivity). For this function you may select the specific structures<br> in the “Network nodes/Brain areas” selection window. When working<br> with the entire matrix, you can also select specific regions using the “Results viewer”<br> in the “The results selection box”.</html>
