<html>Generate Correlation Matrix: by hitting this button GraphVar will prompt you to select the<br> time series signals for creation of the subject specific association matrices. The generated<br> correlation matrices are stored in “your workspace/results/CorrMatrix”. Along with the<br> CorrMatrix array, GraphVar creates arrays for the p-values “PValMatrix” (parametric p-values)/<br> “RandPValMatrix” (non-parametric p-values) and saves them in the subjects .mat file. <br>The computed correlation matrices are automatically loaded into the “Braindata path”.</html>
