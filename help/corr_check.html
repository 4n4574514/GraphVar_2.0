<html>Do correlation/do partial correlation: GraphVar enables you to compute correlations<br> between specific graph metrics (see “Network Calculations panel”) and user defined<br> variables (see “Variables”). GraphVar offers the selection between a regular correlation<br> (pearson correlation) and a partial correlational analysis. When you select the <br>“Do partial correlation” checkbox, you are demanded to select the respective variables in the selection<br> box below that you want to control for. Selection of multiple variables for correlation and as<br> covariates is possible. If you want to do non-parametric testing of the correlation strenght (r)<br> please refer to the “Test against random networks (Correlation)” option.<br><br><b>It is also possible to perform correlational analyses on the “raw” correlation/association matrices<br> (i.e., association-matrix based statistics, where no graph topological measures are<br> involved). For this feature please refer to the “Raw Matrix –Correlation” panel.</html>
