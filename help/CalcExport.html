<html>Calculate variables and export: when pushing this button, the selected graph metrics will<br> be computed for each subject (with respect to the settings in the “Network Construction” panel)<br> and stored in an excel/csv sheet. When generating subject specific null-model networks, GraphVar will not export each subjects null-model network derived graph metric <br>(these values can be retrieved from the results folder), but will still use these values<br> to compute and export the normalized metrics.</html>
