<html>Normalize graph metrics with random networks: when you select this option the computed<br> network measures are respectively normalized by the according network measures <br>computed from the subject specific null-model networks (see “Generate null-model networks”),<br> i.e. normalization by the mean of the null-model derived measures: <br>GraphVarnormalized= (GraphVaroriginal_network/mean(GraphVarrandom_networks)).<br> When you use this option, you cannot “Test against random networks” when doing correlations.</html>
