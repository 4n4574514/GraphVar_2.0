<html>Do Group Comparison: GraphVar enables you to compute group comparisons with specific<br> graph metrics as dependent variable (see “Network Calculations panel”), whereas the group<br> membership of each subject is specified by the user defined variable, e.g. gender, genotype, etc.<br> (see “Variables”). With GraphVar you have the possibility to compute comparisons<br> between 2 groups (i.e., 2 sample t-test) or to find differences between more than two<br> groups (i.e., ANOVA). GraphVar will automatically detect how many groups are encoded in<br> the selected variable and subsequently apply the appropriate test (i.e., two sample t-test<br> or ANOVA). Selection of multiple variables for group comparisons is possible.</html>
