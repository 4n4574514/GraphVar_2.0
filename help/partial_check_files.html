<html>Partial correlation (control for nodes): gives you the possibility to create association<br> matrices based on partial correlations using the subject’s time series signals. You have the<br> option to compute partial correlations considering all nodes in the network but also to <br>select specific nodes to control for when computing the correlation matrix. When selecting <br>this checkbox you will be reminded of this by a help dialog “Please select nodes from<br> network node menu in the network construction panel”. When constructing a network based <br>on partial correlations you will have to be very careful with a post-hoc redefinition of your<br> network (which will still be possible but may be methodologically invalid). To start<br> generating the matrices just click and refer to the “Generate Correlation Matrix” option.</html>
