<html>Generate null-model networks: allows creating subject specific null-model networks <br>(with the same settings as the original networks – i.e. threshold range, number of nodes) that can<br> be used for normalization of the network topological measures (including calculation of small-worldness), and for non-parametric testing of <br>the significance of correlations among network measures with user defined variables (see “Test against random networks (Correlation)”).<br> The number of subject specific random networks to be created and the <br>function used to generate such a network depends on your<br> input (randomizer_bin_und, randmio_und, randmio_und_connected, null_model_und_signed;<br> please refer to the description of these functions on the website of the brain connectivity toolbox; please also refer to“Appendix 2:” for how to <br>include your own functions for null-model network<br> generation into GraphVar). The number of iterations refers to the second argument in the <br>randomization functions (e.g., to “swap_bins” for the “null_model_und_sign” function). <br>For reliable and valid assumptions using null-model networks it is advisable to generate a high<br> number of reference networks. Reference networks created with this option are not used as<br> reference association-matrices as needed for computing network based statistics <br>(see “The Raw Matrix (link wise) panel for info on network based statistics).</html>
