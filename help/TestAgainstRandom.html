<html>Test against random networks (Correlation): this feature allows non-parametric testing of<br> the correlation strenght (r) between a network measure with any user defined subject<br> variable (e.g. age) against the correlation between the graph theoretical measure derived<br> from the subject specific null-model network (see “Generate null-model networks”) with the<br> same subject variable (e.g. age). Based on the number of subject specific null-model <br>networks a null-model distribution of these “random” correlations (prior transformation of r to z values<br> using Fishers transformation) is generated from which a non-parametric p-value<br> for the “original” correlation is retrieved by placing the “original” correlation value in the <br>corresponding null-model distribution and determining its percentile position<br> (please refer to the “Correlate” panel for how to correlate user defined variables with the graph metrics<br> and to the “Results” section under “Correction” for significance correction using non-parametric p-values).</html>
