
---- Known Bugs on Windows and MAC with Matlab 2017 and ElasticNet machine learning -----------

This GraphVar version contains a compiled version of Glmnet for Matlab

provided here:
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/download.html

As this mex file was compiled under Matlab 2012a we experienced compatibility issues when
running ElasticNet models on MAC and Windows with newer Matlab versions (2017). On MAC the file
appears as invalid and on Windows ElasticNet may crash in some cases and cause Matlab to freeze.

If you experience these issues please downgrade to an older Matlab version or use Ubuntu/Linux systems
(here we did not experience any issues).

We highly appologize for this inconvenience and will try uploading a more compatible mex file with
the next major fix (within the next weeks).

WE ARE SORRY!
